```

### Step 3: Update Repository Information

**IMPORTANT**: Before publishing, update these placeholders in `package.json`:

```json

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 4: Version Management

For future releases, update versions using npm:

```bash
# For patch releases (bug fixes)
npm version patch

# For minor releases (new features)
npm version minor

# For major releases (breaking changes)
npm version major
```

**Current version**: 1.0.0 (initial release)

### Step 5: Publish to NPM

```bash
# Publish to npm (public registry)
npm publish

# Or publish with specific tag (for beta releases)
npm publish --tag beta
```

### Step 6: Verify Publication

```bash
# Check if package is published
npm info expo-geofencing

# Install your own package to test
npm install expo-geofencing
```
